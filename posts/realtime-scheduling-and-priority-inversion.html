      <div class="article-content">
        <p>When I&#39;m <a href="http://www.citruscircuits.org/">programming robots</a>, something that often comes up is &quot;realtime&quot; code. What does code being realtime mean? Simply put, realtime code has a known upper bound on the amount of time that it can take to execute. That rules out quite a few things:</p>

<ul>
<li>Any operation involving the network</li>
<li>Any operation involving reading or writing files</li>
<li>Any operation that allocates memory</li>
</ul>

<p>And those are just a few of the things that will make code non realtime.</p>

<p>We use Linux for our code, so we end up using what&#39;s called the <a href="https://rt.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page">RT-PREEMPT</a> patch. This makes it possible for userspace programs to be realtime in Linux. The main thing that this changes is Linux&#39;s <em>schedluer</em>. The scheduler&#39;s job is to choose when to run which thread, and which program. In order to figure out why RT-PREEMPT changes the scheduler, let&#39;s look at how Linux&#39;s default scheduler compares to the RT-PREEMPT scheduler:</p>

<p>Default (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Completely_Fair_Scheduler">CFS</a>):</p>

<ul>
<li>Prioritizes giving all tasks equal run time</li>
<li>Runs in O(log N) time, where N is the number of tasks</li>
<li>No task is higher priority than another</li>
</ul>

<p>RT-PREEMPT:</p>

<ul>
<li>Prioritizes running higher-priority tasks first</li>
<li>All realtime tasks have a priority</li>
<li>High-priority tasks can &quot;pre-empt&quot; lower priority tasks and run instead of them</li>
</ul>

<p>As you can tell, CFS focuses on more general systems, while RT-PREEMPT focuses on letting specific tasks meet strict timing requirements. This is important, for example, when we have a thread that runs a controller for a robot, which we need to run at <em>exactly</em> 200Hz.</p>

<p>However, there are a few problems that can come with this scheduling system. The main problem is priority inversion. To give an example of priority inversion, let&#39;s consider a simple pre-emptive scheduler:</p>

<ul>
<li>Every task has a priority</li>
<li>A high priority task can choose to &quot;pre-empt&quot; a lower priority task, and run instead of it</li>
<li>If a task needs a resource that only one task can access at a time, it will lock it with a mutex, so no other task can use it</li>
</ul>

<p>Now, let&#39;s imagine how a system that uses this scheduler could go wrong.</p>

<p>We&#39;ll have three tasks: one high priority task, one medium priority task, and one low priority task. We also have one shared resource, which can only be used by one task at a time:</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/1.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 1"></p>

<p>Next, Task 3, which is low priority, will start to run and will acquire a lock on Resource 1, meaning that no other tasks can use it:</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/3.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 3"></p>

<p>Next, Task 2, which is medium priority enters a section of the code that needs to be realtime (called a <em>critical section</em>). This pre-empts Task 1, but Task 1 <strong>still has a lock on the resource</strong>.</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/4.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 4"></p>

<p>Now, Task 1 - the highest priority task in the system - enters a critical section which needs to use the resource. It can&#39;t use the resource, because Task 1 has a lock on the resource, and it can&#39;t pre-empt other tasks, because it needs the resource to run it&#39;s code! Task 3, the task that has the lock, can&#39;t do anything about this though, because it&#39;s being pre-empted by Task 2 ðŸ˜¢</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/5.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 5"></p>

<p>Finally, once Task 2 is done doing it&#39;s thing, Task 1 can resume running and finish with the resource:</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/6.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 6"></p>

<p>And Task 1 can finally have the resource and run:</p>

<p><img src="../img/priority_inversion/7.jpg" alt="Priority inversion 7"></p>

<p>So that&#39;s how a high priority task can be blocked by a lower priority task that doesn&#39;t need a resource. This is one of the main problems with the scheduler that I&#39;ve described (called &quot;Fixed priority pre-emptive scheduling&quot;).</p>

<p>So how do you fix this problem?</p>

<p>As it turns out, it&#39;s fairly simple - in order to release the lock, our low priority task has to have at least the same priority as the medium priority task that&#39;s pre-empting it. The way that the RT-PREEMPT Linux patch does this is by setting the priority of a task that has a lock on a resource to the priority of the highest-priority task that&#39;s waiting for that resource. In our example, that would mean that as soon as Task 1 wanted the resource, Task 3 would be set to high priority, and pre-empt Task 2, allowing it to finish with the resource and allow Task 1 to run as soon as possible.</p>

<p>This is a easy solution that will fix the priority inversion issue!</p>

<p>I hope that this has been a good intro to what priority inversion is, why it&#39;s a problem, and how to it&#39;s fixed. It definitely gave me some ideas as to things that I could research in the future:</p>

<ul>
<li>How does CFS work?</li>
<li>How does the RT-PREEMPT scheduler work (in more detail)?</li>
<li>Are there other ways to fix priority inversion?</li>
</ul>

<p>All could be good topics for a future post.</p>

<p>Anyway, that&#39;s all for now!</p>
