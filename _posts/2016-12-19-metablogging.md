Two and a half years ago I started blogging. I set up a wordpress site on an old (and I mean _old_) dell machine running in my closet, and started writing posts.

Fast forward to today - I found an archive of my old posts, and decided that it's time to start blogging again ❤️

There's a few reasons that I decided to start up again:

1. I've been reading Julia Evans' blog, which I like a lot, and stumbled on [this post](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/)
2. I was cleaning out my hard drive and found an archive of my old blog. It's really interesting to see the progress that I've made in two years!
3. I want a way to publish small things that I find out or do. A blog seems like the perfect medium for this :)

And within a few hours, I had my nice pretty statically generated site on github pages with a custom domain name.

Of course, it's useless to start up my blog again without adding any content, so here are some ideas of things that I might post about:

* Control theory
  * PID Controllers
  * State space controllers
* New languages that I'm learning
  * Rust
* Cool linux features and utilities that I learn about
