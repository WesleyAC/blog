I've decided to start a series of posts on [Control Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Control_theory)! Here's why:

* Control Theory is really cool, but there aren't many resources available on the internet to learn it ðŸ˜¢
* I know a bit about control theory through FRC, and I want to spread that knowledge to others
* I haven't done the actual code for a lot of this yet, but I want to have an excuse to write it!

Here's the index of things that I want to write eventually. I may not do them all, and won't do them in this order:

* Part Zero: Index (This post!)
* [Part 1: PID](/posts/intro-to-control-part-one-pid)
* [Part 2: PID Tuning](/posts/intro-to-control-part-two-pid-tuning)
* [Part 3: Simulation](/posts/intro-to-control-part-three-simulation)
* [Part 4: State Space](/posts/intro-to-control-part-four-state-space)
* [Part 5: Feed Forward and Motion Profiling](/posts/intro-to-control-part-five-feedforward-motion-profiling)
* [Part 6: Pole Placement](/posts/intro-to-control-part-six-pole-placement)
* Motor Models
* Example Systems/System Modeling
* State Space Observer
* Kalman Filters
* LQR

As I add more topics, I'll edit in links and change the ordering so that it makes sense.

I'm particularly excited to do the State Space and Kalman ones, since I haven't learned those topics quite yet!
